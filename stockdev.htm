          <p><strong>The history of stocks cannot be rounded down to one event. </strong> However, it is clear that the large-scale enterprise, the Dutch East India company, unknowingly established the grounds for modern day stock exchange, during 1612-1623 (Michie). </p>

          <p>Gold, porcelain, silk, and spices were obtained from their initial intra-Asian trades, which soon expanded to long distance trade between Western Europe and India (Prakash). </p>
            
            <p>However, as the Dutch East Indian company grew, so did their need for funding.</p>
            
            <p>  The company turned to the States General of the Dutch Republic, the year 1602 establishing the Dutch East-Indian Company as a “privately-owned company”, in which the government of the Dutch Republic influenced the population to invest (Petra). Through this affiliation, “1143 investors signed up … in Amsterdam alone” (Petra). The guaranteed share in the annual earnings of the trade gained the trust of the investors, who were paid in an annual dividend (Michie). </p>
            
            <p>This brief history paved the path for the stock exchange, an important but under-taught concept everyone can benefit from. </p>

          <h3>Initial Public Offerings</h3>
          <h5>Can you really invest in <i>any</i> company? <span class="w3-opacity">August 7, 2022</span></h5>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          <img src="https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/image/largest-companies-logos-1200-1628004453.jpg" alt="Companies 2022" style="width:100%" class="w3-padding-16">
          <p><strong>The Dutch East India Company</strong>  is credited for introducing the first stock exchange system however, by offering their shares to the general public, they also established the first introduction to IPOs, id est. the Initial Public Offering (Fernando). </p>

            <p>A common misconception about the stock exchange is that people can invest in any company&#39;s stocks. </p>
            
            <p>That&#39;s far from the truth for only public companies are allowed to offer shares to the general public (Kenton). But there is no need to worry as the Initial Public Offering “debuts” a private business into the Official Public Market, hence labelling it as a &#39;public&#39; business (Fernando). This enables companies to trade their shares to the general public (Fernando) who then become partial owners of the company. Yes, you my dear reader can become a partial owner of Microsoft, Tesla, or even Youtube (and if you twist the wording a bit, technically that means you also partially own PewDiePie&#39;s channel) (Beers). </p>
            
                <p>   Nevertheless, it is important to address some very common misconceptions that investors may develop as the &#39;partial owner&#39; of Apple or any business (Beers). </p>
            
         <p>   As much as we love to develop god complexes like our dear friend Light Yagami, make sure you don&#39;t let it seep into your stock ownership reader (Beers). </p>
            
         <ul>
            <p>   <li> Although you will be regarded as the partial owner of the company, you do not gain the ability to control the company&#39;s decisions and choices, so we&#39;re sorry to tell you this, but you&#39;re going to have to work a bit harder to become the CEO of Apple (Beers). </li></p>
                <p>  <li> Discounts. We all love them (Light Yagami definitely liked to discount people&#39;s lives). Yet, we regret to inform you that you are not entitled to a discount as the partial owner of KFC (Beers).</li> </p>
                    <p>  <li> Now we all know our best friend Light Yagami seized people&#39;s lives, but we must inform you that as a Roblox investor, you do not have the right to seize their assets and property. However, if a company becomes insolvent, there is a possibility that you may obtain some money. If the company used their property, and assets as collaterals, the second party, who are involved in the collateral contract, have the right to seize the company's property for their own profit. And, if there is any remaining money left from the assets, it will be distributed to the stockholders, aka you if you decide to be as smart as L and invest :) (Beers). </li></p>
         </ul>

          <p><strong>There is a ticking time bomb on the value of your money;</strong>  the longer it stays, locked in a savings account, the faster it will lose value in a few years of time (Tarver).</p>

           <p>Sounds crazy, trust me, when I first heard it, I thought it was impossible. Nevertheless, in this less than perfect world, there is something called inflation, and it has an impact on the “time value of money” (Tarver).</p> 
            
            <p> <i> Maybe this is why Light Yagami did what he did.</i></p>
            
                <p> To put it into perspective, let&#39;s say you have a Happy Meal for $1, in 2022; that same Happy Meal can cost $2 in 2023 because of inflation. </p>
            
                    <p> There is a constant flow of money and as it generates, it loses value  (Tarver).</p>
            
                        <p> If the concept still does not make sense, think about it this way: if your mum gave you one cookie to take to kindergarten, and you really loved that cookie, you would not give it to your friend for 1 fruit roll up. No, you would ask your friend for 5 fruit roll ups, even though the cookie isn&#39;t <i>that</i> special. </p>
            
                            <p> But, if you had 5 cookies, and your friend asked for 1 cookie, you would probably exchange it for one fruit roll up because, now that you have more cookies, they aren&#39;t as special to you because you have 4 more to your disposal (unless you&#39;re a greedy child like my brother, then that&#39;s a different story). </p>
            
                                <p> Inflation is an inevitable force that will constantly act upon your life. Sounds scary doesn&#39;t it? </p>
